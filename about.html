        In the Rigveda, an ancient Indian sacred collection of Vedic Sanskrit
        hymns, the city is referred to as Kāśī (काशी:Kashi) from the Sanskrit
        verbal root kaś- "to shine", making Varanasi known as "City of Light",
        the "luminous city as an eminent seat of learning".

        According to Hindu mythology, Varanasi was founded by Shiva, one of
        three principal deities along with Brahma and Vishnu. During a fight
        between Brahma and Shiva, one of Brahma's five heads was torn off by
        Shiva. As was the custom, the victor carried the slain adversary's head
        in his hand and let it hang down from his hand as an act of ignominy,
        and a sign of his own bravery. A bridle was also put into the mouth.
        Shiva thus dishonored Brahma's head, and kept it with him at all times.
        When he came to the city of Varanasi in this state, the hanging head of
        Brahma dropped from Shiva's hand and disappeared in the ground. Varanasi
        is therefore considered an extremely holy site.
